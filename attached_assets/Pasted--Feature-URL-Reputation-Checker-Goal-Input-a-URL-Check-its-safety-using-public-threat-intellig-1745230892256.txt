🎯 Feature: URL Reputation Checker
Goal: Input a URL → Check its safety using public threat intelligence APIs → Display result to the user

🧱 SYSTEM OVERVIEW (Feature-centric)

Component	Role
Input Validation Layer	Validates and sanitizes the URL from the user.
Reputation Engine	Sends request to threat intel APIs like VirusTotal / Google Safe.
Decision Engine	Analyzes response and assigns a threat level (Safe, Suspicious, Bad)
UI Layer (CLI/Web)	Displays final result in user-friendly format.
Logging Module	Logs query data for user feedback or offline processing.
🧰 REQUIRED LIBRARIES & TOOLS
Language: Python
Why: Easy to build, test, extend, and port later to web or extension.


Purpose	Tool/Library
Input/Output	argparse, input(), or Flask
HTTP Requests	requests
API Parsing	json
URL Processing	validators, urllib.parse
Logging	logging
SOLID/Design	Modular Classes, Interfaces
✅ WORKFLOW (Industry-Style, SOLID Principles)

🧪 SOLID PRINCIPLES USED

Principle	How It's Used
S: SRP	Each class has one responsibility: validation, querying API, parsing, rendering.
O: OCP	Easily add more API clients (GoogleSafeBrowsingClient, etc).
L: LSP	Subclasses like VirusTotalClient behave as expected from ReputationService.
I: ISP	Only relevant methods implemented in each module.
D: DIP	Main app depends on abstraction ReputationService, not specific classes.
🧠 PROMPT TO IMPLEMENT THIS (Step-by-Step)
Here’s a coding prompt you can feed into a project or give to ChatGPT again to start building:

Prompt:

"Build a Python-based URL reputation checker that uses SOLID principles and system design best practices. The tool should:

Accept a URL input from the user (either CLI or Flask API).

Validate and sanitize the input using a Validator class.

Use an abstract base class ReputationService that defines a check_url(url) method.

Implement a concrete class VirusTotalClient that sends the URL to VirusTotal using their free API and parses the response.

Optionally extend to other APIs like Google Safe Browsing.

Use a DecisionEngine class to evaluate threat score and return a result: SAFE, SUSPICIOUS, or DANGEROUS.

Log each check using Python’s logging module for offline analysis.

Display the verdict in a CLI or Flask-based web UI.

Use the following libraries:

requests for API calls

json for parsing

validators for input sanitization

abc for interface design (abstract base classes)

logging for logs

Follow SOLID principles, use modular files if possible, and use object-oriented programming best practices."
